Simultaneous localization and mapping algorithm implemented in C#.

## Short description ##
A SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) implementation using LEGO Mindstorms EV3 and EV3 API 1.0.0.

## General description ##
  * The robot can be controlled by the user from a proper interface.
  * The user can overwrite the steering of the robot from this interface.
  * The generated map can be saved to the hard drive.
  * The measurement data generated by the sensors is visible on the user interface.
  * The robot uses distance sensors (infrared sensor).
  * The mapping algorithm is written in C#.
  * The algorithm was developed in Visual Studio 2013.
  * The connection between the robot and the PC can be a USB cable or Bluetooth wireless connection.
  * The results from the sensors are displayed on canvas.
